# Odysseus-Rising
A 7 Level Partial Conversion for GZDoom featuring Odysseus the Protogen. Written in ZScript.

## Overview
A 7 level partial conversion for GZDoom featuring Odysseus the Opossum Protogen crash-landing on Europa after answering a distress signal from a large aerospace military research facility, and finding themself in the middle of a demonic invasion they are going to have to clean up before the demons have a chance to make it off of the moon’s surface and spread their chaos across the solar system.

Featuring a shield and armor system, cooldown-based abilities and a grading system to reward completion. This mod’s gameplay aims to provide something different enough to have its own identity, while retaining enough of its core to preserve the high-intensity action that Doom fans love.

## Goals
1. To learn how to map and build a working knowledge of level design.
2. Develop practical programming and scripting skills.
3. Learning to create art assets in the context of game dev.
4. Break into learning ZScript, and wean off using the DECORATE-ACS handshake method of scripting.

## Requirements
- GZDoom version 4.11.0, which could currently be found in the [DRDTeam Devbuilds Repo](https://devbuilds.drdteam.org/gzdoom/).
- A graphics card capable of running GZDoom in Hardware rendering mode.
